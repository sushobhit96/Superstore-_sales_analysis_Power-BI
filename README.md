Dataset source- Kaggle-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales/data

Context- The growth of supermarkets in most populated cities are increasing and market competitions are also high. The dataset is one of the historical sales of supermarket company which has recorded in 3 different branches for 3 months data.  

In this project, I have crated the dashboard using Power BI, analysed and visualized the dataset. I used this dataset to discover some aspects: 

•	Sales Trend in general across cities.

•	Gender Distribution of Customers

•	Type of Customers -members and normal

•	Total sales by product category

•	Rush Hour in Supermarket and product preferences during rush hour

•	Customer rating patterns

Steps:
•	Loaded the data into Power Query Editor

•	Transform/ Cleaning the dataset- finding null values, duplicate entries, rounding off decimal data type, changing data type, removing redundant columns, inserting columns- week of year, hour, month, for analysis 

•	Visualizing the data- by using Column chart, Bar chart, Pie chart, Slicers, Clustered column chart, Donut Chart, Dill Through function, Tooltips, etc

Key findings:

The store has a greater number of online transactions compared to cash however credit card usage is less compared to other categories.

Highest sales come from Food and Beverages category.

Stores have not increased the membership of customers, its stagnant.

Maximum rush hour is in the evening and most customers are buying Food and beverages products.

Highest average rating- Food and Beverages
Lowest average rating -Home and Lifestyle
In health and Beauty there is marked difference between no of customers buying and average rating.
